<h1> Fibonacci sequence </h1>

<p>When trying to calculate nth number of Fibonacci sequence,
in order to avoid unnecessary recursive calls or
extensive memory usage, it helps to imagine painting canvas
of dimensions x and y that are consequtive Fibonacci numbers.
The canvas is enlarged in each step by adding a square next to
its larger side. It is also rotated, in each step, by 90 degrees
from portrait to landscape orientation. That way canvas shape,
as it should, slowly approaches golden ratio.</p>
